# PBR Studio

**[PBR Studio](https://jouniverse.github.io/pbr-studio-app/shader/shader.html)** is a visualization and rendering tool for textured materials.

## Features

- Visualize materials with different textures
- Render materials

## Usage

1. Upload texture maps as .jpg, or .png files. The required maps are: base color, normal, roughness, and metallic. Optional maps are: height and ambient occlusion.
2. Apply the textures to the geometry.
3. Change the geometry of the base object, lighting, environment map intensity, and camera angle. Change the material properties on the fly. The user can alter how much weight the different texture maps have on the final visualization.
4. Render the material (save as .png).
